# ICS Newton Software

In the 1990's, Innovative Computer Solutions released multiple programs
for the Newton MessagePad as shareware, in addition to commercial releases
of NewtCase and X-Port.

This repository contains files related to that software, starting with a
Python script to generate the shareware registration codes used in five
of the products.
