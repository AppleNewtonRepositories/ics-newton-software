inLine 1.3(C)1994 Innovative Computer Solutions, All Rights ReservedWritten by Dan Rowley, Documentation by Tom Collins< Overview>	inLine is an outline assistance autopart for the Notepad.  When installed, it adds a button to the bottom of the Notepad.  Click on the button to bring up a palette that has buttons for adding a new entry at the same level, starting a new level, backing out to the previous level, or inserting a bullet.< Installation Notes >	Install inLine the same way you install other Newton packages (e.g., the Connection Kit).  You will notice that since inLine is an autopart, it doesn’t appear in the Extras Drawer..  You can still remove it just like any other package though.  NOTE:  If you install it on a card, do not remove the card with the inLine palette open.< Usage >	inLine is simple and easy to use.  Click on its button to bring up the palette.  Move the palette by dragging its border.  Set an insertion point in a note by tapping once.  Tap on the ">>" button to move in one level, tap on "√" to add another entry at the same level, tap on "<<" to back out to the previous level and tap on "•" to insert a bullet.  If you hold down the left arrow, or hit the left arrow when you’re at the top level, inLine will reset itself and start a new outline.  Tap on the close button to close the palette.< Known Limitations >	inLine is not dynamic - it will not compensate for deleted lines or new lines.  It will start repeating after 26 entries on one level.  The inLine palette will reset if you close it.  inLine was intended as a small and fast program for formatting quick outlines in the Notepad and not to be a full blown outliner.< Registration Information >	This application is currently Postcardware (this may change in a future version).
