NewtCase 1.2(C)1994 Innovative Computer Solutions, All Rights ReservedWritten by Dan Rowley, Documentation/Graphics by Tom CollinsATTENTION:  Please read this file entirely, especially the Warnings and Disclaimers section.  If you do not understand how NewtCase works, you may run into some surprises.  Archived packages ARE NOT BACKED UP through the Connection Kit.  DO NOT archive packages with NewtCase if you don’t have a backup copy on disk that you can reinstall from.NOTE:  Version 1.2 of “Tibbott’s Bookcase” is included with this archive.  If you have been using Bookcase, please replace it with this version.  It fixes a conflict with NewtCase.< Overview >	NewtCase lets any MessagePad (Classic, MP100, MP110) user archive his/her Newton applications to reduce heap memory requirements, alleviate conflicts between applications, and clean up his/her Extras drawer.  Archived (or “NewtCased”) packages do not show up in the Extras drawer, but can be reinstalled at any time using NewtCase.  With NewtCase, you can temporarily deinstall applications without having to remove them from your MessagePad.  NewtCase can launch an archived package and, when you quit from that package, automatically re-archive it.  Using NewtCase, you could keep a hundred applications on your 4 meg card without overflowing your heap space or Extras drawer.< Installation Notes >	Install NewtCase as you would any other package (with the Connection Kit or some other utility).  NewtCase will work if installed on a PCMCIA card (no Grip ‘O Death).  If NewtCase is installed on a card, do not remove the card if you are running archived packages.  When you quit the archived packages, wait until they disappear from the Extras Drawer before removing the card.	If you are upgrading from a previous version of NewtCase, you can just remove the old version and replace it with this one.  Your archived packages will be unaffected.  Please remove the QuickRun package that came with v0.9B2.  It is incompatible with NewtCase 1.2.  If you feel there is still a need for a separate QuickRun package, let us know.	If you are downgrading from version 2.0 of NewtCase, please reinstall all NCK Archives and refile packages stored in the last three sets (originally called User 1, User 2 and User 3).  Version 1.2 cannot access the NCK archives, and will only diplay items filed in the last three sets when viewing “All Packages”	Version 1.2 of “Tibbott’s Bookcase” is included with this archive.  If you have been using Bookcase, please replace it with this version.  It fixes a conflict with NewtCase.< Usage >	You can launch NewtCase from the Extras Drawer, or you can just tap on the word “Extras” in the Extras Drawer icon (see Figure 1). 	When you launch NewtCase, it displays two lists (see Figure 2).  One list contains installed “active” packages.  The other list contains packages in your NewtCase.  Packages on a locked card will appear with a bullet in front of their names.  You cannot modify these files unless you unlock the card.  The numbers following package names in the Installed Packages list indicate the size of each package.  The numbers in the Archived Packages list indicate the size and estimated heap usage of each package.  NewtCase can tell if you remove or insert a memory card, and will update its lists accordingly. 	To archive a package (put it in your NewtCase), highlight it in the Installed Packages list and tap on the “Archive” button (see Figure 3).  Archived packages stay where they are and continue to use storage space, but not heap space.  They are invisible to all other applications, including ones that backup packages (to a card, or through the Connection Kit). 	To reinstall the package (take it out of your NewtCase), highlight it in the Archived Packages list and tap on the “Reinstall” button (see Figure 4).  If the archived package has been damaged or erased in some way, NewtCase will tell you about it, and give you the option to remove that package’s entry in the NewtCase.  If this happens, you will have to reinstall the package with the Connection Kit. 	You can remove a package by highlighting it in either list and tapping on the “Remove” button.  You cannot remove an archived package if you have an installed package with the same name.  You can also launch a package from either list by highlighting it and tapping on the “Run” button.  When you launch an archived package, NewtCase will de-archive it and run it.  You may notice a delay between when the “NewtCase is working” message disappears and the program launches.  When you exit the package, NewtCase will re-archive it automatically within 15 seconds.	Due to inconsistencies in naming conventions, NewtCase can’t launch all books.  We recommend using Tibbott’s Bookcase (included with this archive) to manage your NewtonBooks.  However, archiving/reinstalling/removing books works fine.	Click on the “?” button for registration and contact information.	The available heap is displayed in a button in the upper-left hand corner.  Clicking on the button performs a garbage collection (gc()).< Categories >	You can limit the archived packages list to one of the categories or “All Packages” by tapping on the category selector above the Archived Packages list (see Figure 5). 	You can categorize archived packages in one of seven categories:  Unfiled, Books, Communications, Games, Utilities, Applications and Other.  To change a package’s category, select it in the Archived Packages list and tap on the folder button (see Figure 6).  When you archive a package, it is placed in the current category, or “Unfiled” if you have “All Packages” selected. < Warnings and Disclaimers >	WARNING, NewtCased packages are invisible to ALL OTHER APPLICATIONS.  Once you archive a package, you can only get it back with NewtCase.  The MessagePad CANNOT backup archived packages - make sure you have a (non-archived) backup copy before archiving a package.	DO NOT delete NewtCase’s soups (with a utility such as StewPot or RemoveIt) unless you have unarchived ALL NewtCased packages on that device.  If you delete the soup on a card that has packages NewtCased on it, you will lose access to those packages, and will not be able to recover the memory they use.	WARNING, you must remove your storage card before locking or unlocking it (as documented on page 196 of the original MessagePad Handbook).  NewtCase (and other applications) will get confused if you lock or unlock the card while it is still in the MessagePad.	WARNING, NewtCase will not work if the card is locked AND you have “Store New Items on Card” selected on the card slip.	WARNING, BookCase v1.0 by Michael Tibbott will fail if you run an archived package on your Newton.  Please use Tibbott’s Bookcase v1.2.	WARNING, Time Accountant v2.0 fails when using NewtCase, upgrading to v2.01 solves the problem.	USE CAUTION, when running NewtCase while other package management utilities are running (e.g., RemoveIt, ExtraExtras, ScrollEx).  Performing an operation in one might confuse the others.< Registration Information >	This application is SHAREWARE.

NewtCase and a new version (1.2) of Tibbott’s Bookcase now get along fine.  Quick-access extras button is now a little shorter.  The “NewtCase won’t be able to remove package” message is gone.  If NewtCase can’t run a package, it will rearchive it for you.  Running books is a little more reliable, but a lot of books still will not run.  Archive list now updates properly when you switch sets.	1.0 - First non-beta release.  Added Extras drawer button, integrated NewtCase and QuickRun, fixed bug when launching archived packages with the extras drawer full, fixed scrolling bug when deleting last item in a list, added categories for archived packages, can launch installed packages and remove installed packages, and lists display 8 packages instead of 6.	0.9b2 - Second beta release, fixed bugs found in v0.9b.	0.9b - Initial public release.< Technical Info >	NewtCase does not store packages in its soup.  It takes them “offline”, but stores a reference to them in its soup.	If you have an entry in your archive listing a -0.9k heap, it indicates that there was a problem archiving that package.  The affected package may or may not have been archived successfully.	NewtCase cannot open a book unless its ISBN matches its package name.	Sometimes the screen will blank out when performing an action.  This is because some other  application has forced the root view to redraw and is perfectly normal.	NewtCase responds to broadcasts of system soup changes by updating its lists accordingly.  NewtCase also broadcasts “soup changed” messages when making changes to the installed packages.  If you would like more info about supporting these broadcasts in your applications, contact Dan Rowley at dan@newts.com.< Legal Mumbo Jumbo >	Newton, MessagePad, Connection Kit and Apple are registered trademarks of Apple Computer, Inc.
