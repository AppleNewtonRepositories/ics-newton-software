PrefsPatch 1.2(C)1994 Innovative Computer Solutions, All Rights ReservedWritten by Dan Rowley, Documentation/Icons by Tom Collins< Overview >	PrefsPatch is a small patch for the Newton MessagePad which corrects what we consider an annoying user interface “feature.”  Namely, that you have to click twice to exit the Prefs or Formulas rolls.  When you install Prefs Patcher, it replaces the close box in these rolls with one that works PROPERLY, requiring only one click to close the roll.  You can still click on the overview button to get back to the overview.  The application also places a dual-function button on the notepad status bar for one tap access to the Formulas and Prefs rolls.< Installation Notes >	Install PrefsPatch as you would any other package (with the Connection Kit or some other utility).  PrefsPatch will work if installed on a PCMCIA card - the patch and notepad button will disappear if you remove the card though.< How does it work? >	When PrefsPatch starts up, it fixes the Formulas and Prefs rolls by placing a REAL close button over the existing one.  It also installs a button on the Notepad using Jesse Devine’s Button Development Kit.  When you tap on it, the button determines whether or not you hit the Formulas half (designated by the "F") or the Prefs half (designated by the "P").< Registration Information >	This application is FREEWARE.
