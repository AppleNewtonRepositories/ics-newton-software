GraffitiPatch 1.6(C)1995 Innovative Computer Solutions, All Rights ReservedWritten by Dan Rowley, Documentation by Tom Collins< Overview >	GraffitiPatch is a small (approximately 8k of storage and 1k of heap) patch for the Newton family of products that implements a number of enhancements related to Graffiti by Palm Computing.  It allows quick access to Graffiti from the standard Newton keyboard and enhances Graffiti, allowing you to shrink the Graffiti window and/or drag it partially off-screen, giving you much more flexibility in placement.   Shareware, $10.< Disclaimer >  ICS has no connection whatsoever with the Palm Computing, publisher of Graffiti.  This package was not commissioned by, nor is it endorsed by said publisher.  It has been tested with the latest available version (1.01), and is not guaranteed to work with future versions.  If you should encounter problems using this patch, please do not contact Palm for technical support.  Palm Computing does not approve or disapprove of this enhancement.< Installation Notes >	There are two packages in the GraffitiPatch 1.6 distribution.  GP16-Top.pkg displays the ZCN buttons across the top of the zoomed Graffiti view, GP16-Rgt.pkg displays them on the right.	Install GraffitiPatch as you would any other package (with the Connection Kit or some other utility).  It will not appear in your extras drawer.  In order for it to be able to patch Graffiti, it must be installed AFTER Graffiti.  If Graffiti is installed on the card, then GraffitiPatch must be installed on the card  If you install GraffitiPatch on a card, do not attempt to remove the card while the Newton keyboard or Graffiti is open (visible).  The Newton will inform you that it still needs the card and you will have to reinsert it.    GraffitiPatch does not permanently modify Graffiti.  To stop using the patch, simply remove GraffitiPatch as you would any other Newton Package.< How does it work? >Unpatched Graffiti: Patched:  	GraffitiPatch adds a small button to the standard Newton keyboard that, when tapped, will immediately launch Graffiti.  The button appears as a small “G” next to the close box of the keyboard window.  Now, there is no need to keep the Graffiti floater open if it obstructs your view, since you can access Graffiti from anywhere you can access the keyboard.	GraffitiPatch remembers which keyboard you used last (alpha or Graffiti) and will display that whenever you double-tap the screen or tap on the keyboard button.  Also, GraffitiPatch will close the current keyboard (if open) when you double-tap the screen or tap on the keyboard button with.	GraffitiPatch modifies Graffiti itself to provide for more convenient positioning of the Graffiti window.  Without GraffitiPatch, you are strictly limited to the dimensions of the screen when dragging the window.  With GraffitiPatch installed, you can drag the window almost completely off the screen, allowing you to place it out of the way without closing it, or place it with only a portion of the input window showing.  (Power Tip:  Dan likes to drag it so it covers the “Find” and “Assist” buttons.  Not only does free up more of the screen, but it relocates the stroke area to a part of the screen less affected by scratches.)	GraffitiPatch also adds three additional buttons to the Graffiti window.  First, it adds a “K” button that will switch back to the alpha keyboard.  Second, it adds a proper close box in the lower right hand corner.  Click on the close box, and Graffiti will close (completely).  Click on the original Graffiti minimize button (which still shows behind the close box) and Graffiti will minimize.  Third, it adds a zoom button (labeled “z”) which shrinks the Graffiti window so it is exactly as large as the writing box.  Click the zoom button again to bring the window back to full size.  While zoomed, you still have access to the Caps and Num Lock buttons.NOTE: If you use a heap cleaner like Quickies, make sure you exclude both Graffiti and the alphaKeyboard.  If you do not, GraffitiPatch will forget which ‘state’ it is in, and parts of the patch will be clobbered.< Registration Information >	This application is SHAREWARE.
