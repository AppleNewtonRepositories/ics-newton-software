Version : 1.03
Released : 1/1/1998

***A note about this version of BarKeep

	This version of BarKeep is primarily a maintenance release, with changes that are largely invisible to the user.  A number of changes were made with regard to the demo portion of the program, to make it less prone to time-out prematurely.

***A note to GestureLaunch users

	GestureLaunch 3.0 includes the functionality of BarKeep.  If you already have GesturLaunch 3.0, you do not need to install BarKeep.  The packages deliberately both have the same name to prevent them from both being installed at the same time.

***What is BarKeep?

	BarKeep is an extension for the Newton MessagePad 2000 which allows you to customize the location and appearance of the "soft" button bar.  Key features include the ability to:
	*) Store more icons by adjusting the space between icons
	*) Store more icons by turning off text labels
	*) Customize the button bar with different settings for each screen orientation:
			*) Button bar location (all four sides allowed)
			*) Button bar width
			*) Location of scroll/overview controls
			*) orientation of scroll/overview controls

	Also included with BarKeep is the "KillBB" extension, which allows the user to temporarily disable the button bar altogether, permitting the use of the entire screen.


***ABOUT SHAREWARE

BarKeep is SHAREWARE.  You have fourteen days to try BarKeep and determine if it's right for you.  If you want to keep it, you need to register it (If you don't register, it will stop working after 14 days).  The registration fee is $15.  Upgrades to new versions of the shareware version of BarKeep are free to registered users.  You can register BarKeep several ways-

	1 - (preferred) Via the Kagi Shareware registration service - you can register online by visiting our web site at
		<http://www.newts.com/>.  You can jump directly to the ICS order page at <http://order.kagi.com/?IC>.  You 
		should receive a code within 48 hours of registering online.
	2 - On Compuserve via SWREG (GO SWREG), #15149.
	3 - By sending a check for $15 (US) to Innovative Computer Solutions at 23005 N 21st way; Phoenix, Arizona 85024.

	When we receive your registration, we will send you a code to unlock your copy of BarKeep.  Choose the "Register" option on the BarKeep prefs screen to enter your registration code and unlock your copy of BarKeep.  



***Installing BarKeep

	Install BarKeep as you would any other Newton software, by downloading it to your device using the Newton Backup Utility, Newton Package Installer, X-Port, or other package installation utility.   BarKeep will install a new item in the system 'prefs' application.  Tapping on the BarKeep icon in your extras drawer has no effect.  Launch the buit-in 'prefs' application and choose "BarKeep" to configure your button bar.
	Because of the nature of BarKeep and KillBB, we strongly recommend that you install both extensions INTERNALLY (ie; not on a card) if you regularly remove your card.  Do not attempt to remove a card with KillBB on it while the small floating button bar is visible.


***BarKeep preferences

	There are two different types of button bar settings controlled by BarKeep - global settings, and orientation-specific settings.  Global settings apply to all screen orientations, and orientation-specific settings apply only to a single screen orientation (note that the two possible landscape orientations and two possible portrait orientations are distinct from each other, giving a total of four possible screen orientations).

	*) Global settings
	Icon spacing - Adjusts the amount of space between icons on the button bar.  Choose smaller
	settings to fit more icons on the button bar.  Note that if your icons are very close together,
	you will probably want to turn off text labels.

	Icon text labels - Controls whether text labels are displayed under icons in the button
	bar.  You may choose to display labels ALWAYS, NEVER, or only when the screen is in
	portrait or landscape orientation.

	*) Orientation-specific settings
	ButtonBar location - Controls the location of the button bar.  The button bar may be
	positioned on the TOP, LEFT, RIGHT, or BOTTOM of the screen.

	ButtonBar thickness - Controls the thickness (width or height) of the button bar.  A
	narrower button bar allows more screen space for running applications, but may clip 
	larger icons.  Note that if your button bar is very narrow, you will probably want to
	turn off text labels.  If you choose the smallest thickness ("Tiny"), your icons will be
	shrunken to approximately 60% of their original size.

	Scroll/Overview location - Controls the location of the scroll/overview control cluster.
	If the button bar is located on the left or right, the controls may be located at the TOP
	or BOTTOM.  Similarly, if the button bar is located on the top or bottom, the controls
	may be located on the LEFT or RIGHT.

	Overview position - Controls the location of the overview button relative to the scroll
	arrows.  You may choose to place the overview button INSIDE the arrows (towards the
	inside of the screen), OUTSIDE the arrows (towards the edge of the screen), or on the 
	LEFT or RIGHT of the arrows. 

***Other features

	BarKeep includes the "KillBB" extension, which allows you to temporarily remove the button bar altogether, allowing you to use the entire screen.  If you choose to install KillBB, it will add an icon to your extras drawer called "KillBB," which you can drag to your buttonbar if you like.  When you tap on the button, the button bar will be closed, and the screen redrawn to occupy the entire screen area.  In the button bar's place will be a small floating button bar.  The floating button bar provides access to the extras drawer, the scroll arrows and overview, an undo button, and a button to bring the full button bar back.  

	The button at the bottom/right of the floater is used to bring back the full button bar, either temporarily or permanently, depending on how you tap it.  If you simply tap it, the button bar will appear *ON TOP OF* the where it usually resides (as opposed to redrawing the screen to accomodate it), and will disappear when you choose a button.  If you tap and hold for a second or so, you will hear a second click, and then the screen will be redrawn with the button bar restored to it's previous location.

	The KillBB button bar may be drawn in either horizontal or vertical orientation.  To change the orientation of the floating button bar, simply double tap on the drag handle at the top/left of the button bar.  You may drag the floater partially off screen if you wish.


***KNOWN ISSUES WITH VERSION 1.0 of BarKeep

	BarKeep exposes a number of button-bar related preferences which allow the user to configure their button bar in ways that although "legal", could certainly be considered to be "non-standard" (landscape with the button bar on the bottom is a typical example).  Since BarKeep is the first (although certainly not the last) application which exposes these situations, we're finding that a number of application developers have made assumptions about screen orientation and size which are not necessarily "safe."  (assuming that the screen will always be at least 320 pixels tall is the most common of such assumptions, and the second most common is assuming that the button bar will exist at all).  The symptom of this problem is that some applications will refuse to open when the button bar is configured in these "non standard" ways.  We have contacted each of the developers as they come to our attention, and are working with them to resolve the issues (the fix is generally quite simple), but I ask that you bear with us (and them!) as we work through these "growing pains."  As a rule of thumb, if the application did not allow rotation on the MessagePad 120/130, it will not work in Landscape orientation with the button bar on the top or bottom.  As I noted earlier, the fix is generally very simple, and I'm working with developers to solve the issues as they come up.  For developers among you, the following statement summarizes the issue:

"When the screen is less than 320 pixels tall, all child-of-root views (ie; all application root views and views created with BuildContext) must have a reorientToScreen method (even if this method does nothing, or simply calls :redochildren()), or the user will be presented with a dialog warning that the application can not run in that screen orientation.  On an mp2000/mp2100, the screen can be made to be less than 320 pixels tall by placing the soft buttonbar on the "long" edge of the screen in landscape mode."

***CHANGE HISTORY

***Changes in 1.03

	This version of BarKeep is primarily a maintenance release, with changes that are largely invisible to the user.  A number of changes were made with regard to the demo portion of the program, to make it less prone to time-out prematurely.

***Changes in 1.0


	* The "Ultra-narrow" icon spacing has been renamed "Narrowest," and "Ultra-narrow" is now a
	new setting between "Super-Narrow" and "Narrowest."

	* The KillBB floater checks every few seconds to make sure it's on
	top, and if it isn't, it moves itself there.  If the floater gets
	obscured, wait a few seconds, and it should reappear.

	* Tiny icons are not as badly distrorted in the process of reduction.

	* Bug fixes.

***Changes in 1.0b4

	* Numerous bug fixes in both BarKeep and KillBB
	* KillBB floater is no longer transparent, because it was taking too long to simulate
	the transparency effect- the delay was causing skips in handwriting recognition.  Even
	though it only took 4/60ths of a second to draw, it was sufficient to cause the recognition
	system to "hiccup."
	* The KillBB floater may now be dragged partially off-screen.
	* The orientation of the KillBB floater can be changed between horizontal and vertical
	by double-tapping on the drag handle.
	* You can now "temporarily" bring back the button bar from the KillBB floater if you just
	want to launch one item from the button bar.  Tap and hold on the expansion button to bring
	the button bar back permanently.
	* You can now enter a registration code into BarKeep to shut it up.  Because this version
	is still a beta, IT WILL STILL EXPIRE on June 1st, but a final version will be available by
	then.
	* Grayscale icons
	* Less clipping of icons in vertically-oriented button bar when icons are close together.
	* There's now an undo button on the KillBB floater.
	* There's a new option in the "This application can't operate in this screen orietentation.." 
	dialog which allows you to force the app to open anyway, as a temporary workaround to the
	incompatibilities/conflicts that cause some apps not to open in landscape when the 
	button bar is on the "long" side of the screen.  Note that you should only choose this option
	if you are sure the application will work properly.  The application may obscure
	the button bar when it opens.  If you force an application to open and it fails, you may need
	to restart your Newton.
